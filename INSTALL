Apters is written in Haskell, and packaged using the standard installer
for Haskell programs, called Cabal (http://www.haskell.org/cabal/).
Cabal and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler are included in the Haskell
Platform (http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), and are also widely
available in Linux distributions. For example, if you're using Debian,
you can install the cabal-install and ghc (or ghc6, for older versions)
packages.

Once you have Cabal and GHC, you can compile and install Apters and its
dependencies by running
	cabal install
from the top level of this source tree. By default, Cabal will install
Apters in ~/.cabal/bin/.

For more details, including the manual process you can follow if you
don't want to use Cabal, see:
